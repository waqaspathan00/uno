# Purpose
This project was built to teach to my students at The Coder School. I also built out this project whenever I am learning a new language because it demonstrates and helps you practice many foundational programming concepts like:
- variables
- lists
- functions
- conditional statements
- loops

It also introduces you to some intermediate topics as well:
- enumerating lists
- console delay and output
